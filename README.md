# WindkesselModel

This bachelr thesis analyzes the Watt & Burrus model applied to a four-element and microcirculation systems and also presents a Matrix model. The input flow is added with two different functions in the Matrix model and this model is applied to a twoelement, four-element and a microcirculation system under which Euler integration are applied. The fitted pulse wave is compared to the measurements of blood
pressure and analyzing their features. In this thesis, a Fourier model is also applied to the three systems and with the help of this model, physiological parameters are estimated. This thesis focuses on the analysis of the parameters and designs to find the reason for the parameter differences between Watt & Burrrus model and Matrix/Fourier model. The Fr√©chet distance is used to determine the similarity between the fitted curve and measured data. The thesis ends with a comparison among the three models.
